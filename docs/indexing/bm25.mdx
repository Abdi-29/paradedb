## What is BM25?

BM25, which stands for Best Matching 25, is the go-to choice for many modern search engines like ElasticSearch.
It ranks documents by considering how often a term appears and how unique that term is across all
documents. BM25 is especially useful when you need to find exact keywords or phrases within documents.

The BM25 index enables full text search over a table and relevance scoring using the BM25 algorithm.

## Creating a BM25 Index

The following command creates a BM25 index over a table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX [index_name]
ON [schema_name].[table_name]
USING bm25 (([table_name].*));
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index. The index name can be anything, as long as doesn't
  conflict with an existing index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="schema_name">
  The name of the schema, or namespace, of the table. The schema name only needs
  to be provided if the table is not in the `public` schema.
</ParamField>

Once an index is created, it automatically stays in sync with the underlying table as the data changes.

## Deleting a BM25 Index

The following command deletes a BM25 index:

```sql
DROP INDEX [index_name];
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index you wish to delete.
</ParamField>

## Recreating a BM25 Index

A BM25 index only needs to be recreated if the underlying table schema changes â€” for instance, if a new
column is added or the name of a column changes. To recreate the index, simply drop and create it:

```sql
DROP INDEX [index_name];

CREATE INDEX [index_name]
ON [schema_name].[table_name]
USING bm25 (([table_name].*));
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index. The index name can be anything, as long as doesn't
  conflict with an existing index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="schema_name">
  The name of the schema, or namespace, of the table. The schema name only needs
  to be provided if the table is not in the `public` schema.
</ParamField>

## Supported Data Types

The BM25 index will index columns with following Postgres data types: `text`, `varchar`, `boolean`, `int2`,
`int4`, `int8`, `oid`, `xid`, `float4`, `float8`, `numeric`, `json`, and `jsonb`. If your table has columns
with other data types, they are ignored and not added to the index.
