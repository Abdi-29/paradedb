This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with ParadeDB:

1. Run ParadeDB locally
2. Connect to ParadeDB
3. Execute full text search
4. Execute similarity search
5. Execute hybrid search

## Run ParadeDB Locally

<Note>
  This step is for developers who wish to run ParadeDB themselves. If you are
  using ParadeDB Cloud, you may skip this step.
</Note>

To start ParadeDB, run the Docker image:

```bash
docker run \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may set `user`, `password`, and `dbname` to whatever values you want — these will be your database
connection credentials. By default, this will start a ParadeDB instance at `http://localhost:5432`.

## Connect to ParadeDB

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Ensure that you have `psql` installed on your machine.
</Info>

To connect to ParadeDB, run

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <user> -d <dbname> -p <port> -W
```

If your ParadeDB database is running at `http://localhost:5432`, `hostname` is `localhost` and `port` is 5432. If you are using ParadeDB cloud, your connection credentials can be found in the cloud console.

## Execute Full Text Search

ParadeDB comes with a pre-populated table called `paradedb.mock_items` to help you get started.
Once connected with `psql`, run the following command to preview the first five rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mock_items AS SELECT * FROM paradedb.mock_items;
SELECT * FROM mock_items LIMIT 5;
```

This should return

```bash
 id |       description        | rating |  category
----+--------------------------+--------+-------------
  1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard |      4 | Electronics
  2 | Plastic Keyboard         |      4 | Electronics
  3 | Sleek running shoes      |      5 | Footwear
  4 | White jogging shoes      |      3 | Footwear
  5 | Generic shoes            |      4 | Footwear
(5 rows)
```

Next, let's index this table for full-text search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mock_items ON mock_items USING bm25 ((mock_items.*));
```

Under the hood, this creates a Postgres-native, inverted index called `idx_mock_items` for your table.
Finally, let's execute a full-text search:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics OR rating>2';
```

This should return

```bash
 id |         description         | rating |  category
----+-----------------------------+--------+-------------
  2 | Plastic Keyboard            |      4 | Electronics
  1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard    |      4 | Electronics
 12 | Innovative wireless earbuds |      5 | Electronics
 22 | Fast charging power bank    |      4 | Electronics
 32 | Bluetooth-enabled speaker   |      3 | Electronics
(5 rows)
```

You may have noticed the above SQL query makes use of
the custom `@@@` operator and a mini query language. This mini language supports boolean queries, filtering,
range queries, and more. Detailed documentation of this mini language is coming in the next few days.
