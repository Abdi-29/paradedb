title: Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with ParadeDB:

1. Run ParadeDB locally
2. Connect to ParadeDB
3. Execute full text, similarity, and hybrid search

## Run ParadeDB Locally

<Note>
  This step is for developers who wish to run ParadeDB locally. If you are using
  ParadeDB Cloud, you may skip this step.
</Note>

To start ParadeDB, run the Docker image:

```bash
docker run \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may set `user`, `password`, and `dbname` to whatever values you want — these will be your database
connection credentials. By default, this will start a ParadeDB instance at `http://localhost:5432`.

## Connect to ParadeDB

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Ensure that you have `psql` installed on your machine.
</Info>

To connect to ParadeDB, run

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <user> -d <dbname> -p <port> -W
```

If your ParadeDB database is running at `http://localhost:5432`, `hostname` is `localhost` and `port` is 5432. If you are using ParadeDB cloud, your connection credentials can be found in the cloud console.

## Full Text Search

ParadeDB comes with a pre-populated table called `paradedb.mock_items` to help you get started.
Once connected with `psql`, run the following command to preview the first five rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mock_items AS SELECT * FROM paradedb.mock_items;
SELECT * FROM mock_items LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ```csv id | description | rating | category
  ----+--------------------------+--------+------------- 1 | Ergonomic metal
  keyboard | 4 | Electronics 2 | Plastic Keyboard | 4 | Electronics 3 | Sleek
  running shoes | 5 | Footwear 4 | White jogging shoes | 3 | Footwear 5 |
  Generic shoes | 4 | Footwear (5 rows) ```
</Accordion>

Next, let's index this table for full-text search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mock_items ON mock_items USING bm25 ((mock_items.*));
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">```bash CREATE INDEX ```</Accordion>
Under the hood, this creates a Postgres-native index called `idx_mock_items`, which
stores the necessary information for full text search over the `mock_items` table.
Let's execute a full-text search:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics OR rating>2';
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv id | description | rating | category
  ----+-----------------------------+--------+------------- 2 | Plastic Keyboard
  | 4 | Electronics 1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard | 4 | Electronics 12 |
  Innovative wireless earbuds | 5 | Electronics 22 | Fast charging power bank |
  4 | Electronics 32 | Bluetooth-enabled speaker | 3 | Electronics (5 rows) ```
</Accordion>

You may have noticed the above SQL query makes use of
the custom `@@@` operator and a mini query language. This mini language supports boolean queries, filtering,
range queries, and more. Detailed documentation of this mini language is coming in the next few days.

## Similarity Search

Let's vectorize the `description` column so we can query it with natural language:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items
ADD COLUMN embeddings vector(384)
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (pgml.embed('all-minilm-l6-v2', description || ' ' || category)) STORED;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">``` bash ALTER TABLE ```</Accordion>

<Note>
  This command may take some time depending on the size of your table.
</Note>

This SQL command creates a new column called `embeddings`, which stores the embeddings representations
of the `category` column appended to the `description` column using the HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
The `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` command ensures that these embeddings are updated in real time whenever the values
in `description` or `category` change.

Now, let's query our table using the natural language query "Something a kid would play with":

```sql
WITH query AS (
    SELECT pgml.embed('all-minilm-l6-v2', 'Something a kid would play with')::vector AS embedding
)
SELECT description, category, rating
FROM mock_items, query ORDER BY mock_items.embeddings <-> query.embedding LIMIT 4;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | category | rating
  ------------------------+----------+-------- Colorful kids toy | Toys | 1
  Interactive board game | Toys | 3 Plush teddy bear | Toys | 4 Robot building
  kit | Toys | 4 (4 rows) ```
</Accordion>
