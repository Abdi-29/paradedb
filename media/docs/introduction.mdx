ParadeDB a Postgres-based ElasticSearch alternative, engineered for lightning-fast full text, similarity, and hybrid search.

We're currently in private beta.
The focus of the core team is on developing the open-source version of ParadeDB, which we will be launching in winter 2023.
We're also building a self-serve managed cloud version, which will launch in early 2024.

Our full documentation hasn't gone live yet, but will soon. In the meantime, check out our blog for the latest!
